# Static Wireframe Project

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This project is a simple, static webpage design I created using CSS and HTML only. The structure of the page was based on a basic wireframe (see "Context"), while the content of the page was meant to reflect a page from a movie-aggregator-type website, Ã  la Letterboxd or IMDb. The page is styled for device-width responsiveness as well.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was an assignment for the third week of the second module of Turing's front-end software engineering program. I spent approximately 35 hours creating it.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project included further honing our CSS skills, while also integrating proper semantic HTML with accessibility in mind. We were provided with a basic wireframe from which we could deviate in terms of color palette and content, but our designs had to be structurally identical to the wireframe (see below).

### Wins & Challenges
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- My biggest challenge for this project was committing to using more device-width responsiveness within my initial styling. In past projects, I hadn't taken advantage of setting element widths/margins/paddings/etc. with percentages or using Flexbox as often I should have. That approach created more work when I got to the media query stage of styling and a less-responsive design overall. Because of this, I decided to style everything from the ground up with these things in mind. I had to remember to think several moves ahead when setting attributes, and how a decision might affect the page's overall responsiveness, despite whether it was working at the moment.

- One "win" I experienced was choosing to use Grid for the iPhone-width nav bar at the last minute, without any prior experience with Grid. I got it to work the way I had in mind pretty quickly and made the project deadline.
